# Welcome to Streamlit!

Edit `/streamlit_app.py` to customize this app to your heart's desire :heart:

If you have any questions, checkout our [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io) and [community
forums](https://discuss.streamlit.io).

In the meantime, below is an example of what you can do with just a few lines of code:
"""

def pokemon_battle(player1, player2):
    st.write("Let the battle begin!")
    st.write(f"Player 1: {player1}")
    st.write(f"Player 2: {player2}")
    st.write("")

    while True:
        # Player 1's turn
        player1_move = st.text_input("Player 1, enter your move:")
        st.write(f"Player 1 used {player1_move}!")

        # Player 2's turn
        player2_move = st.text_input("Player 2, enter your move:")
        st.write(f"Player 2 used {player2_move}!")
        st.write("")

        # Check for battle end conditions
        if player1_move.lower() == "quit" or player2_move.lower() == "quit":
            st.write("The battle has ended.")
            break

        # Perform calculations (simplified)
        # For example, you could add Pokémon health points, damage calculation, etc.

        # Display results (simplified)
        st.write("Results:")
        st.write(f"{player1} used {player1_move} and dealt X damage.")
        st.write(f"{player2} used {player2_move} and dealt Y damage.")
        st.write("")

# Main app
st.title("Pokémon Battle")
player1_name = st.text_input("Player 1, enter your name:")
player2_name = st.text_input("Player 2, enter your name:")

if player1_name and player2_name:
    pokemon_battle(player1_name, player2_name)
